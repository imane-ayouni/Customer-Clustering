## Market Segmentation
For the business development process in general, and for supply chain specifically, an understanding of customer behavior and geographic conditions is a useful method to make better decisions. By extracting commonly shared demographic- and geodemographic characteristics clusters (or segments) can be defined. This allows to apply tailor-made strategies to target customers and optimize supply chain more effectively.
